# Password-Strength-Checker (psc)

The Password-Strength-Checker (psc) is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords using OpenAI's powerful language models. 

This repository is structured into two main components: 

* `password-checker` - for the frontend application
* `password-checker-backend` - for the backend service that interfaces with the OpenAI API.

### Running the Tool

To run the psc tool, you'll need to start both the frontend and backend services. 

Detailed instructions are provided in the respective README.md files within the password-checker and password-checker-backend directories.

* For the frontend application, navigate to the password-checker directory and follow the setup instructions.
* For the backend service, head over to the password-checker-backend directory and follow the instructions to get it up and running.
